    "PyCIGAR is a connection between grid simulators (OpenDSS, GridLab-D,...) and the scalable RL library RLlib. PyCIGAR formalises grid control problem as a RL problem and provides environments to conduct a variety of RL experiments without concern about the difference between grid simulators and scaling up RL experiments.    \n",

    "To run PyCIGAR, you need a feeder and load-solar profiles on different nodes on that feeders.\n",
    "- Distribution feeder: a distribution feeder definition to feed to grid simulator.\n",
    "- Load/solar generation profiles: `.csv` file of load and solar generation profiles.\n",
    "  \n",
    "In this tutorial, we use a 3-node feeder sample and load-solar profiles in `pycigar/tutorials/data/` to understand the concept of PyCIGAR.\n",
    "- `ieee3.dss` contains the configuration of 3-Bus feeder (source bus, loads,...).\n",
    "- `load_solar_data.csv` contains load, solar profiles of the 3-Bus feeder. The headers S701a, S701b, S701c denote the load profiles at those feeders. The headers S701a_pv, S701b_pv, S701c_pv denote the solar profiles at those feeders.\n",

    "You can run a simulation on this network without doing any training, in this case you won't need a \"RL environment\". After you finish this tutorial, we will move forward to create RL environments, train your own agents and visualize the results.\n",
