Local Installation of PyCIGAR
==================

To get PyCIGAR running, you need two things: PyCIGAR, Simulator (e.g. OpenDSS,
Gridlab-D & OMF...) and a reinforcement learning library (RLlib).

**It is highly recommended that users install**
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`_ **or**
`Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_
**for Python and the setup instructions will assume that you are
doing so.**

Installing PyCIGAR
------------------------

In this section we install PyCIGAR.

If you have not done so already, download the PyCIGAR github repository.

::

    git clone https://github.com/toanngosy/pycigar.git
    cd pycigar

We begin by creating a conda environment and installing PyCIGAR and its
dependencies within the environment. This can be done by running the below
script. Be sure to run the below commands from ``/path/to/pycigar``.

::

    # create a conda environment
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    source activate pycigar

If the conda install fails, you can also install the requirements using pip by calling

::

    # install PyCIGAR within the environment
    pip install -e .

The option `-e` will allow you to modify PyCIGAR module and it will directly change the module
without the need for reinstallation.

Testing your installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the above modules have been successfully installed, we can test the
installation by running a few examples. Before trying to run any examples, be
sure to enter your conda environment by typing:

::

    source activate pycigar

Let’s see some action:

::

    python examples/opendss/test_env.py

Install Ray RLlib
----------------------------

PyCIGAR has used RLlib as a reinforcement learning library.
First visit <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/doc/source/installation.rst> and
install the required packages.

The installation process for this library is as follows:

::

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/ray-project/ray.git
    cd ray/python/
    python setup.py develop

If missing libraries cause errors, please also install additional
required libraries as specified at
<http://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html> and
then follow the setup instructions.

Testing your installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See `getting started with RLlib <http://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rllib.html#getting-started>`_ for sample commands.

To run any of the RL examples, make sure to run

::

    source activate pycigar

In order to test run an PyCIGAR experiment in RLlib, try the following command:

::

    python examples/rllib/test_rllib.py

If it does not fail, this means that you have PyCIGAR properly configured with
RLlib.

To visualize the training progress:

::

    tensorboard --logdir=~/ray_results

If tensorboard is not installed, you can install with pip:

::

    pip install tensorboard

For information on how to deploy a cluster, refer to the `Ray instructions <http://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoscaling.html>`_.
