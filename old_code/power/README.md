This is the framework that I intend to use [RLlib](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rllib.html) for scalable RL and compatible with multiple simulations.
I develop this framework under my personal repository so that I could use TravisCI to help me check the build. 
This branch is up-to-date with my personal repository, this framework is reserved under CIGAR project.
